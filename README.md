alogrithmns
===========

Earlier this year I took some time to implement a bunch of alogrithms.  A few of these are already implemented in the python core libraries, but I thought it would be fun to build them out myself.

This code is not production ready.  There are few comments.  There are redundant functions.  So be advised the code should be optimized but they are all working examples.

I did it merely for the fun of implemeting some algorithms that I was studying in my free time.
